## Next.js Rental Property Management System**

Description:

This repository contains a full-stack rental property management system, crafted using Next.js and React for a seamless front-end experience. Integrated with Sanity.io, it offers robust content management, ensuring that property data is easily accessible and modifiable. Styled with Tailwind CSS, the system boasts a modern and responsive design, adaptable to various devices and screen sizes. For handling payments, I've integrated Stripe, providing a secure and efficient transaction process. This system is ideal for property managers seeking a comprehensive, user-friendly, and scalable solution for managing rental properties online. 

Features:
- Dynamic property listings with Sanity.io CMS
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

Perfect for property managers looking to streamline their operations digitally!
